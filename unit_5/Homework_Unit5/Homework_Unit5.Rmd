```{r}

path <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BivinSadler/MSDS-6306-Doing-Data-Science/master/Unit%205/yob2016.txt"

df <- read.delim("yob2016.txt", header = FALSE, sep = ";")

#View head data
head(df)

#Rename column headers to human readable
names(df)[1] <- "First Name"
names(df)[2] <- "Gender"
names(df)[3] <-"Amount of childern"
head(df)
```

# 1b
```{r}
#Summary of df
summary(df)

#Sturcture of df
str(df)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
